## Changes to the Tutorial
* Added a (rather) Main Menu and Scene Switcher;
* All Text is now TextMesh Pro ([More on why change](https://blogs.unity3d.com/pt/2018/10/16/making-the-most-of-textmesh-pro-in-unity-2018/));
* Pickups being counted based on the parent Game Object, to avoid hardcoding numbers;
* Pickup rotation values are now defined by the user, not hardcoded.
